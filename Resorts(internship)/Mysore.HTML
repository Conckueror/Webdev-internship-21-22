            A couch that you can sink in to and arched windows that frame the lake, 
            try out our cottage on a moonlit night, it’s spectacular. If you wish to relax on the balcony, 
            you’ll find yourself shrouded in greenery and wrapped by the breeze that skims off the pool. 
           The bedrooms have soft lights and ambient mood lighting, not that you’ll need lights in here till 
           it’s late evening. Keep the curtains closed for a toned down ambience..<br>
